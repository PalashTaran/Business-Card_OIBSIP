# Business-Card_OIBSIP
(Task 3)

I've used Canva software to build the assigned task.
Have added my work logo on the front side of the business card, with a brown bg.
Have added dummy contact number, email id, address and website with proper representative icons. Added a pyramid and a disk graphic to give it a professional and attractive look.
As a part of the representation, I've added both the sides of the business card in a single canvas and applied glow shadow effect for highlighted upliftment on the canvas.
